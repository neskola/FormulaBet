# App Engine Cron with Google Cloud Functions

> This project is a fork of the [firebase/functions-cron](https://github.com/firebase/functions-cron) project, but modified to use purely HTTP triggers instead of Pub/Sub.

Google App Engine provides a Cron service. Using this service for scheduling, you can build an application to
reliably schedule tasks which can trigger Google Cloud Functions.

This sample contains two components:

* An App Engine application, that uses App Engine Cron Service
    to call Cloud Functions HTTP URLs with a specified Header for validation.

* A sample Cloud Function which triggers hourly and checks for the specified validation Header.

## Configuration

By default this sample triggers hourly. If you want to
customize this schedule for your app then you can modify the [cron.yaml](/appengine/cron.yaml).

For details on configuring this, please see the [cron.yaml Reference](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/standard/python/config/cronref)
in the App Engine documentation.

## Deploying

The overview for configuring and running this sample is as follows:

### 1. Prerequisites

* If you donâ€™t already have one, create a
    [Google Account](https://accounts.google.com/SignUp).

* Create a Developers Console project.
    1. Install (or check that you have previously installed)
        * [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
        * [Python 2.7](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7/)
        * [Python `pip`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing.html)
        * [Google Cloud SDK](http://cloud.google.com/sdk/)
    2. [Enable Project Billing](https://support.google.com/cloud/answer/6293499#enable-billing)

### 2. Clone this repository

To clone the GitHub repository to your computer, run the following command:

    $ git clone https://github.com/eeg3/gcp-functions-cron-http

Change directories to the `gcp-functions-cron-http` directory. The exact path
depends on where you placed the directory when you cloned the sample files from
GitHub.

    $ cd gcp-functions-cron-http

Leave the default cron.yaml as is for now to run through the sample.

### 3. Deploy to App Engine

1. Configure the `gcloud` command-line tool to use the desired project.
```
$ gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
```
2. Change directory to `appengine/`
```
$ cd appengine/
```
3. Install the Python dependencies
```
$ pip install -t lib -r requirements.txt
```
4. Create an App Engine App
```
$ gcloud app create
```
5. Deploy the application to App Engine.
```
$ gcloud app deploy app.yaml \cron.yaml
```
6. Open [Google Cloud Logging](https://console.cloud.google.com/logs/viewer) and in the right dropdown select "GAE Application". If you don't see this option, it may mean that App Engine is still in the process of deploying.
7. Look for a log entry calling `/_ah/start`. If this entry isn't an error, then you're done deploying the App Engine app.

### 3. Deploy to Google Cloud Functions

1. Ensure you're back the root of the repository (`cd ..`, if you're coming from Step 2)
1. Deploy the sample function to Google Cloud Functions
```
$ gcloud beta functions deploy scheduledfunction --trigger-http
```

### 4. Verify your Cron Jobs
We can verify that our function is wired up correctly by opening the [Task Queue](https://console.cloud.google.com/appengine/taskqueues) tab in AppEngine and
clicking on **Cron Jobs**. Each of these jobs has a **Run Now** button next to it.

The sample functions we deployed only has one function. To trigger
this job, let's hit the **Run Now** button for the `/hour` job.

Then, go to the logs for the Google Cloud Function, and you should see a successful `console.log` stating `Header validated. Function executing.`.

### 5. You're Done!

Your cron jobs will now "tick" along forever. As I mentioned above, you're not
limited to the schedule that is included
in the AppEngine app. You can add more scheduled functions by modifying the [cron.yaml](/appengine/cron.yaml) file and re-deploying.
